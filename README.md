   - Click Save

## üìù Customizing Your Resume

### Editing resume.json

Your resume data lives in `resume.json` at the root level. Follow the [JSON Resume Schema](https://jsonresume.org/schema/) for the complete specification. The existing file serves as a working example.

Key sections:

- `basics`: Name, contact info, profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.)
- `work`: Work experience
- `education`: Educational background
- `skills`: Technical and professional skills
- `projects`: Personal or professional projects
- `awards`: Awards and recognition (optional)
- `certificates`: Certifications (optional)

### Creating Tailored Resumes (Profiles)

Create different versions of your resume for different applications:

```bash
mkdir -p profiles/job-type
cp resume.json profiles/job-type/resume.json
# Edit profiles/job-type/resume.json with tailored content
```

Then manually generate that profile's resume using resume-cli (see below).

### Changing the Theme

The project uses `jsonresume-theme-macea` by default. To use a different theme:

1. Browse available themes at [JSON Resume Themes](https://jsonresume.org/themes/)
2. Update `.github/workflows/build_resume.yaml` (lines 24-25, 30-31) with your theme name
3. Update `package.json` with the new theme dependency
4. Push changes and let GitHub Actions rebuild

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install -g resume-cli
npm install
```

Generate your resume locally:

```bash
# Generate HTML
resume export --theme=jsonresume-theme-macea resume.html

# Generate PDF
resume export --theme=jsonresume-theme-macea resume.pdf
```

## üìö How It Works

1. You edit `resume.json` with your resume data
2. Push changes to the `master` branch
3. GitHub Actions workflow triggers:
   - Installs resume-cli and the theme
   - Generates HTML and PDF files
   - Trims PDF to one page using Python script
   - Commits generated files back to the repo
4. GitHub Pages serves the `index.html` file at your site URL
